# Wilde Things - A study in PHP

Wilde Things is a website on which you can buy quotes Oscar Wilde.  This is a PHP demo that demonstrates integrating Stripe, originally done for a General Assembly livestream tutorial on November 14, 2012.

The demo is 7 steps and goes from setting up a simple site for accepting one-time payments to a subscription-based service complete with webhook support.
